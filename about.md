> What is so impressive about that new [proprietary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) IDE? I have been doing that in Emacs for years!

GNU Emacs is well known for its versatility and flexibility, unfortunately there is also a big steep learning curve compared to others editors, but it is also that "complexity" which in the end makes it so powerful and enables you to achieve anything with the editor in the long run.

*EmacSide* aims to show, in a clean and easy way:

* How to achieve with GNU Emacs the most common IDE tasks.

* How to have the same features *(a.k.a. industry demands)* other text editors have.

* How almost any other IDE feature can be done with GNU Emacs.

* Lets you incorporate new tricks to your software development workflow in GNU Emacs.

***EmacSide is not a package nor about elisp code, it aims to show beginner Emacs users how to achieve specific tasks with the available packages.***
